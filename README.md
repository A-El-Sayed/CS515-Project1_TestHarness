# Test Harness - Project 1 - CS515

- About 20 hours
- the way I tested my code is by running it on terminal and started debugging the code using breakpoints on vs code
- I had a lot of bugs, but thankfully i was able to get it all to work
- I had an issue with the test.py program where i could not allow the subprocess to run the actual command lines that were in the PROG.NAME.in files. However, after carefulling debugging the test.py file and realizing that i was using subprocess.communicate instead of subprocess.run and that's why it wasn't working.
- for the three extentions i've chosen to implement, i chose to do "the more advanced wc: multiple files", "more advanced wc: flags to control output", and "More advanced gron: control the base-object name".
